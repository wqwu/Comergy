Use /comergy or /cmg to open the setting window.

Comergy is an addon for monitoring players energy, combo points, focus, rage or runic power. It allows tons of cumtomizations including customized color, sound notifications, bar partitioning and textures.

Why you should use it:
 - It's PRETTY and NEAT.
 - You can flip the bars (right to left), or turn it vertical.
 - You can partition the energy bar (up to 5 sub-bars).
 - Comergy is now available for all power-based classes (Rogue, Cat, Bear, Hunter, Warrior, DK).
 - It switches settings automatically when you switch between talents.
 - It shows player/target's health.
